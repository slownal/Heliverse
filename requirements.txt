Additionally, if you're working in a Jupyter Notebook environment and want to suppress warnings, you can add the following line to your notebook:

```python
import warnings
warnings.filterwarnings('ignore')
```

However, note that ignoring warnings is generally not recommended unless you're sure about the implications. It's often better to understand and address the underlying issues causing the warnings.
